#Authorization Code Examples

Given that the authorization code requires a full application to interact with the browser and AGILE IDM. 
We have created a set of examples in a separate repository that could be used on its own as a guide to develop an oauth2 client 
for AGILE IDM in https://github.com/Agile-IoT/agile-idm-oauth2-client-example. Please check this repository and choose the proper branch 
to use the different capabilities of IDM.
